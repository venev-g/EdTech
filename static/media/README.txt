# Placeholder for avatar_loop.mp4
# In a real implementation, this would be an actual MP4 video file
# For development, you can use any looping video of an avatar/person speaking
# 
# Recommended sources for avatar videos:
# - Record your own video
# - Use D-ID, Synthesia, or similar avatar generation tools
# - Use stock footage from Pexels, Pixabay, etc.
# 
# Place your avatar_loop.mp4 file in this directory: /home/ubuntu/EdTech/static/media/

This file serves as a placeholder reminder.
